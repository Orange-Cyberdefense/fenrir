# FENRIR

FENRIR is a tool designed to be used "out-of-the-box" for penetration tests and offensive engagements. Its main feature and purpose is to bypass wired 802.1x protection and to give you an access to the target network.  

**Keep in mind FENRIR is still a _Work in Progress_**

Branches : 
+ master : main branch for (relatively) stable code
+ bleeding : branch with hotfixes and latest updates

# Usage

*FENRIR must be ran as root and you must have 2 network interfaces if you want it to work*
Also, check that both network interfaces are in promisc mode and that ip_forwarding is enabled (see Install section)

To run it :
```
sudo python Interface.py
```

Notice that FENRIR's interface supports autocompletion

You can run shell commands with "!"
```
!ls -la
```

You first have to create a virtual tap for FENRIR with :
```
create_virtual_tap
```

Then you can either configure it manually or start autoconfiguration :
```
set <option> <value>
autoconf
```

Once FENRIR is configured you can run it normally or in debug mode
```
run
run_debug
```

*The wiki pages are coming shortly with examples and better explanations !*


# Troubleshooting

Are you interfaces in promisc mode ? Even FENRIR's tap interface ?  
You external interfaces must not have an IP address, only the tap hsould have one  
Your default route should be pointing to the tap interface  
Have you enabled ip_forwarding ?  
FENRIR will tell you if it is lacking configuration. It must have at least the legitimate host IP and MAC addresses.  
Not all protocols are currently supported ! But feel free to help the project by creating a module !  
If you have found a bug, report it to me ! I'll look at it as quickly as i can.


# Disclaimer

+ I suck at naming stuff & especially function names
+ The code is always a work-in-progress, there are bugs and weird stuffs ! Feel free to throw bug tickets & pull requests

# Install

+ apt-get update
+ apt-get upgrade
+ apt-get install python-pip
+ apt-get install build-essential
+ apt-get install python-dev
+ pip install python-pytun
+ pip install scapy
+ pip install Cmd2
+ git clone *this repo*

# Important note on install

It seems that with the arrival of Python3 some prerequisite packages are now bugged. For now, to avoid bugs while we migrate this tool to Python3, one should remove any files from the following packages and install them like this:
+ sudo -H -E pip install "cmd2<=0.7.0"
+ sudo -H -E pip install "scapy<=2.3.2"

For running FENRIR 
+ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
+ ifconfig *iface1* promisc
+ ifconfig *iface2* promisc

If you have any problem with installation, shoot me an email ! I can probably help you out !


# Have a beer and participate !

The project is open for pull requests and bug reports ! The great thing is I would be more than happy to offer you a beer for any form of contribution. Please participate in this project and help me make it better :)  
And if you don't know where to start or want some help, do not hesitate to contact me !

Also, if you want to chat about the project or ask questions, you can find me on IRC : __WaffleWrath__
